# ECE-8230-Pattern-Recognition-Code
Code for ECE 8230 Pattern Recognition

A1:

Inside A1 there should be ‘scikit_svm_demo.py’,
this runs a demo on the data from the MNIST database using the scikit-learn machine learning library, specifically the SVM tools.  To run (assuming you have all the required dependencies) simply type ‘python scikit_svm_demo.py’ from command line.  The required data will be downloaded to the current directory if it isn’t already there.  There is also a little demo with my own handwriting.
