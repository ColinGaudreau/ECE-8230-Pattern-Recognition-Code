Code for ECE 8230 Pattern Recognition

A1:

Inside A1 there should be ‘scikit_svm_demo.py’,
this runs a demo on the data from the MNIST database (which can be found in the same directory).  To run (assuming you have all the required dependencies) simply type ‘python scikit_svm_demo.py’ from command line.  Make sure that the other files are in the same directory as the python file. WARNING: this may take a while (1 hour or so).
